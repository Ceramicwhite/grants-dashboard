## A. Application Review Phase

The Application Review Phase consists of the following steps:

- Before submitting an application read this document in its entirety, study project applications with a similar mission in the Program Applications Github repo, and build a relationship with the Stacks community on the Stacks Discord server.
- Submit an application via the [Stacks Foundation Projects Launchpad](https://grants.stacks.org/).
  - _The Project Launchpad creates a Github issue for your project application._
  - _After creating your application all interaction, revisions, updates occur on Github._
- Receive informal feedback received from the community on your application via comments on your Github issue.
- Revise your application based on the feedback you receive.
- Wait for the formal review and determinations for your funding round to be announced.
  > For additional details, see [Application Review Phase Schedule](/docs/application-review-phase-schedule.md)

</br>

## B. Onboarding Phase

The Onboarding Phase consists of the following steps:

- Project Lead verifies identity using a third-party KYC service.
- Project Lead (aka appicant) signs contract and a representative from the Stacks Foundation countersigns contract.
- Initial Payment disbursed at the conclusion of the Onboarding Phase.
- Begin work on your project.
- In total, this process will take 1-3 weeks.

</br>

## C. Milestone Deliverable Phase

Depending on the size of your project budget you may either skip this step, or repeat it several times (see this [chart] for details), but in general, a Milestone Phase consists of:

- Post a link to the completed work and request a review by commenting on your Github issue.
- Allow the Stacks community an opportunity to review and comment on your work verifying it is done as outlined in the project application.
- Once it is determined the work matches the approved project application your Milestone Payment will be disbursed.
- In total, this process will take 1-3 weeks.

</br>

## D. Final Deliverable Phase

The Final Deliverable Phase works just like a Milestone Phase. At the conclusion of this phase you will be awarded your final payment.

# Application Review Phase Schedule

Applications are reviewed in **Groups**. Groups are broken up into two types:

- Applications (under) <$25k
- Applications (over) >$25k

Each Group consists of four **Sections**:

- **A** : Applications Open
- **B** : Applications Close
- **C** : Application Review Committee Week

<br/>

Please note:

- Applications may be _rejected_ during any Section of the Application Review Phase.
