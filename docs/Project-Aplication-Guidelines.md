### Project Requirements

Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a project funded by the Stacks Foundation must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. **We prefer [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), but [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html[), [MIT](https://mit-license.org/) or Unlicensed are also acceptable.**
- Individuals and teams must finish one project before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.

In addition to the information provided on your application, note that your project will need to comply with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md). In particular, we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, _written_ documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product.

Finally, we take licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognised for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery **will lead to immediate termination**. Please reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.

### Project Application Expectations

We expect all applications to:

- Be **rich in technical details** and be well-defined.
- Present a **well-researched** or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
- Demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- Demonstrate **proven experience** with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine these for past activity and code quality. You will also have the ability link to projects on other platforms in your application.
- Clearly show how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that is **new and novel** to the ecosystem yet. It is appreciated if you cite and/or link to other Stacks Foundation projects that may be of similar or complimentary scope to help make your argument.

### Project Application Suggestions

Things we encourage:

- **DO** : Educate yourself on the process. Before submitting your application:
  - Read this document in its entirety.
  - Study project applications with a similar mission in the Program Applications Github repo.
  - Build a relationship with the Stacks community on the Stacks Discord server.
- **DO** : Focus on new & novel, open-source ideas that the Stacks community has a clear demand for, prove there is demand, and prove you can measure how your solution will aid that demand.
- **DO** : Start small and build a relationship. Donâ€™t over ask. We encourage all builders new to the community to first start with a small project with a modest budget.

Things we discourage:

- **DO NOT** : Rely on direct messages and emails for asking questions. Public conversations benefit the entire community and help everyone learn.
- **DO NOT** : Include the cost of material goods in your proposal; i.e. computing hardware, etc.

Before submitting your application, ask yourself the following questions:

- **DOES YOUR PROJECT** : Advance the mission of a more user-owned internet?
- **DOES YOUR PROJECT** : Accelerate a broader adoption of Stacks technology?
- **DOES YOUR PROJECT** : Unlock immidiate and widespread value for the Stacks community?
- **DOES YOUR PROJECT** : Yield new & novel: code, technology, and/or culture on Stacks?
- **DOES YOUR PROJECT** : Have a crystal-clear scope, objective, and audience?
- **DOES YOUR PROJECT** : Have a crystal-clear and measureable (and verifiable) definition of success?
- **DOES YOUR PROJECT** : Have any potential risks? If so, have you identified them and helped us understand how you plan to overcome those risks?
  - Risks could be related to team, security, technological dependencies, and/or market readiness.

## Project Lead Responsiblities

---

When you submit an application, you are considered the applicant or Project Lead. Before you submit, its worth better understanding the responsiblities that come with that role:

- While a project may have several project team members, a project can only have one Project Lead.
- The Project Lead will need to verify their identity (using a third party KYC service) and sign a contract.
- The Project Lead will need to provide tax documentation in the form of a completed 1099, and/or 8ben, fw8ben depending on their home domicile.
- The STX wallet address and memo the Project Lead provides in the original project application will be associated with the contract and cannot be changed.
- Additionally, this address will be the sole wallet to receive funds for the project.
