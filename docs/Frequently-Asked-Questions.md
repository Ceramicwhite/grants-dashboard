## General

### Does a project need to be open-source to receive grant funding?

All code produced as part of a grant must be open-source as explained in the [Project Requirements](/docs/Project-Aplication-Guidelines.md/#project-requirements) section. and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality.

> We prefer [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), but [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html[), [MIT](https://mit-license.org/) or Unlicensed are also acceptable.

### Is there a typical funding range for a certain level of grant type?

Please refer to [Grant Types](/docs/Grant-Types.md) for information concerning funding range for different grant tracks.

### Can I list the Stacks Foundation as a partner?

Grants are not considered partnerships and although we will try our best to make sure that grantees are successful in completing their grants, we ask that you please don't advertise the Stacks Foundation as a partner.

### Does the Stacks Foundation help with PR & Marketing of individual Grants?

The Stacks Foundation does not offer individual marketing for teams. However we do a monthly call to showcase Grants in-progress and we highly recommend all grantees to participate. We may at our discretion also tweet about individual projects at Milestone or Final Deliverable completion.

### Can I reuse someone else’s Clarity Contract or any open-source code as a starting point?

Clarity contracts are human readable by design. The Stacks community and the Grants Team promote the use of reusing contracts already deployed to the Stacks chain. When reviewing a grant application we may ask you to revise your application if asking for funds towards development of smart contracts that have already been deployed. Please search [source-of-clarity.com](https://source-of-clarity.com/) for any potential contracts you can use or build upon before scoping out the funding for your grant.

### One of your grantees is using my code without respecting the terms of its license.

Please email the Grants Team with all relevant information [grants@stacks.org](mailto:grants@stacks.org)

### Does the Grants Team still host an office hours call?

We don't offer any Office Hours call, we are using new channels for seeking help with community input. Please visit the [Discussion Section](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Project-Launchpad/discussions) of the repository

## Submitting A Grant

### Can anyone apply?

Anyone who is not a resident of a country currently under sanction by the United States and can produce documents required to pass onboarding KYC is eligible to apply for a grant.

Over 18?

### Can you apply for and be awarded grants if you are currently in the Stacks Accelerator, Clarity Universe or other Stacks ecosystem programs?

???????????????

### Can I have more than two open grants?

If one of the team members is part of another team that has been awarded a grant that will not disqualify the team applying for a grant.
Individuals applying for a grant must complete the first grant before approval of the second solo grant applied for.

### If you prefer to remain anonymous are you still able to be awarded a grant?

No, all grantees must go through a KYC onboarding process on [Passbase](https://passbase.com/) to receive funding. If the Project lead or solo grantee is unable to submit suitable documents the grant will be declined.

### Can I submit a grant for an event sponsorship?

We accept applications for putting on Stacks related events, specifically for sponsorships of events please reach out the events team first: [events@stacks.org](mailto:events@stacks.org).

### Can I submit a grant to fund my NFT project development?

The Grants Program will not fund the development of the Art. We will consider funding novel smart contracts for non-fungible Tokens.

## Review Process

### How long does the grant review process usually take?

Please refer to [Application Review Phase Schedule](/docs/Process.md#application-review-phase-schedule) for an up to date schedule of when application review will happen.

### Is there a general set of review criteria?

????????????????

### Why are other grant applications receiving feedback and/or approval before mine?

Feedback and review is based on grant track and amount requested. Application review process is irrespective of the order they were received.

### My Application was rejected. Do you have any recommendations on where to go from here?

COME BACK WITH A BETTER IDEA LMAO

### How do I join the application review committee?

?????????????

### Who is on the application review committee?

????????????
Team (Will, Jenny, Shakti, Adam, Shannon, Kenny, Review Committee)

## Funding & Payments

### Can I get an upfront payment?

Grantees receive a tip-off payment once approved and onboarding has finished. The tip-off payment is equal to a Milestone payment. For example if you had a $60,000 grant awarded to you, you will receive a payment of $20,000 upfront and each consecutive milestone payment will also be $20,000.

### How are the value of STX tokens paid out in exchange for grant funding calculated?

The price of STX tokens are calculated on a 7-day rolling average.

### Can I request payment in a token or fiat currency other than STX?

Sorry, the Grants Program only funds grants in STX tokens.

### Once I’ve finished onboarding, how long does it take to receive my first payment?

The tip-off payment and any following Milestone payments can take up to 21 days as explained in the contract. Day 1 begins once onboarding is complete for tip-off payment and Milestone payments processing begins at approval of milestone deliverables.

### Some Level 2 Builder Grants are subject to a portion of the funding being issued as a convertible note, what does that mean?

?????????????????

### How are STX tokens awarded as grant funds taxed?

Please consult with your tax advisor. The Foundation reports all funds paid to grantees to the IRS in accordance with United States Law.

### Where can my STX funds be sent to?

The STX funds can be sent to either a self-custodied wallet or to an exchange. Please Note: If you plan to send to an exchange make sure you have included a memo any tokens sent to an exchange without a memo included on the application must inquire with the support team of the Exchange for how to recover the funds.

### Can I change wallet addresses after I have finished onboarding?

Only in rare cases where the grantee has lost access to the address specified on their application, we will work with them to change the address we hold on file. Please reachout to the [Payments Team](mailto:payments@stacks.org) about address change prior to submitting your next Milestone deliverables.

### The address I listed on my application was wrong and I did not receive my funds, can the Grants Team recover the STX for me and/or replace it?

Unfortunately once the payment has been sent there is nothing we can do, as the chain is immutable. It is the Grantees responsibility to make sure the address on the application and memo if required is correct before submitting their grant.

## Milestone Delivery

### How do I submit a Milestone?

????????????????????

### My Milestones/deliverables have changed since the grant was approved, what should I do?

Please comment on your project within the repo and explain the reasoning for pivoting. The Grants Team has the right to end the grant at this stage.

### Can I submit a Grant for prior work?

We do not approve grants for prior work. Applying for a grant to add new features will be considered as any other grant.

### My Grant has become stale. What does this mean?

???????????

### I am unable to complete my grant, what are the steps for noting the Grants team?

Please comment on your project's issue explaining why this is the case.

### Can I make changes to deliverables after the grant is approved?

Scope of a project change, we expect that. When submitting your deliverables please explain why the pivot was made so not just the Grants Team but others can learn from the experience.

### Can I get help developing my grant from the Foundation team?

We expect applicants to be well aware of the technicals required to develop and complete their grant when submitting their application. The Community and Foundations team members are available to help answer questions and set you up for success in order to complete your application, please join the [Stacks Discord](https://discord.gg/5usXsXSUAK) for help.

## Completion & Beyond

### Can I submit a follow up grant?

Once your grant is complete you are welcome to submit a follow up grant application.

### How long before I can apply for a new grant for a separate project?

You may apply for a new grant for a separate project immediately upon completion of your last grant? If the follow up grant is to continue building on the initial project, we usually like to see feedback from the community in your follow up application
